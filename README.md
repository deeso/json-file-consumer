# JSON File Consumer Service

This project reinvents the wheel with a Python service using *task-blox*.  The goal is to consume JSON files that are written in a periodic manner and provide a way to broadcast these JSON messages to multiple locations.

# Usage

The *sample-suricata-consumer* directory shows how the project can be used.
